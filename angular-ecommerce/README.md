# Angular E-commerce Sample

This folder contains a minimal Angular application that demonstrates the structure of a Flipkart-like storefront. The code is intentionally simple so you can expand on it.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   (Requires internet access.)

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npx ng serve
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:4200` in your browser.

## Project structure

- `angular.json` – Angular CLI configuration.
- `package.json` – dependencies and scripts.
- `src/` – application source code.

This sample includes components for displaying products and a simple cart placeholder. It is **not** a full e-commerce solution but should help you get started with Angular.
